      <p class="main">pet, or companion animal, is an animal kept primarily for a person's company or entertainment
        rather
        than as a
        working
        animal, livestock, or a laboratory animal. Popular pets are often considered to have attractive/cute
        appearances,
        intelligence, and relatable personalities, but some pets may be taken in on an altruistic basis (such as a stray
        animal)
        and accepted by the owner regardless of these characteristics.</p>

        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called
          the
          domestic
          dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by
          hunter-gatherers.
          The
          dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of
          agriculture.
          Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a
          starch-rich
          diet that would be inadequate for other canids.</p>
        <p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Dog breeds vary
          widely
          in
          shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws
          that
          house
          around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs have an
          inferior
          visual acuity, a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large olfactory cortex. They perform many roles
          for
          humans,
          such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, companionship, therapy, aiding disabled people, and
          assisting
          police and the military.</p>

        <p>Communication in dogs includes eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements
          of
          bodies
          and limbs), and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones, and taste). They mark their territories by
          urinating
          on
          them, which is more likely when entering a new environment. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted
          to
          human
          behavior; this adaptation includes being able to understand and communicate with humans. As such, the human
          -
          canine
          bond
          has been a topic of frequent study, and dogs' influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of
          <b>"man's
            best
            friend".</b>

        <p>The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
          mammal.
          <u>It is the only</u> domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have
          shown
          that the
          domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm
          cat,
          but
          also
          ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship and its ability to
          kill
          vermin,
          the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible
          body,
          quick
          reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social
          species,
          but
          a
          solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations - including meowing,
          purring,
          trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting - as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too
          high
          in
          frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
        </p>

        <p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn in temperate zones and throughout the year
          in
          equatorial regions, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats are bred and
          shown
          at
          events
          as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Animal population control of cats may be achieved
          by
          spaying
          and neutering, but their proliferation and the abandonment of pets has resulted in large numbers of feral
          cats
          worldwide, contributing to the extinction of bird, mammal, and reptile species.</p>

        <p>As of 2017, the domestic cat was the <u>second</u> most popular pet in the United States, with 95.6 million
          cats
          owned and
          around 42 million households owning at least one cat. In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with
          an
          estimated
          population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020. As of 2021, there were an estimated 220 million owned and
          480
          million
          stray cats in the world.</p>

        <p>
          Reptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic ('cold-blooded') metabolism and
          amniotic
          development. Living reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines (turtles), Crocodilia (crocodilians), Squamata
          (lizards
          and snakes), and Rhynchocephalia (the tuatara). As of May 2023, about 12,000 living species of reptiles are
          listed
          in the Reptile Database. The study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the
          study
          of
          modern amphibians, is called herpetology.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the Western world, some snakes (especially relatively docile species such as the ball python and corn
          snake)
          are
          sometimes kept as pets. Numerous species of lizard are kept as pets, including bearded dragons, iguanas,
          anoles, and geckos (such as the popular leopard gecko and the crested gecko).

          Turtles and tortoises are increasingly popular pets, but keeping them can be challenging due to their
          particular
          requirements, such as temperature control, the need for UV light sources, and a varied diet. The long
          lifespans
          of
          turtles and especially tortoises mean they can potentially outlive their owners. Good hygiene and
          significant
          maintenance is necessary when keeping reptiles, due to the risks of Salmonella and other pathogens.[178]
          Regular
          hand-washing after handling is an important measure to prevent infection.

          The domestication of small mammals to keep as pets is a relatively recent development, arising only after
          large-scale
          industrialization. Historically, Western society was more agrarian than today, with rodents as a whole
          seen
          as
          vermin
          that were carriers for disease and a threat to crops. Animals that hunted such pests, such as terriers and
          cats,
          were
          prized.

          Many small animals kept as household pets are rodents, including: fancy mice, fancy rats, hamsters (golden
          hamsters and dwarf hamsters), gerbils (Mongolian jirds and duprasi gerbils), common degus, common
          chinchillas,
          and
          guinea pigs (cavies). Non-rodents, including rabbits, hedgehogs and sugar gliders are also kept.

          Fish have been recognized as a source of beauty for almost as long as used for food, appearing in cave art,
          being
          raised
          as ornamental fish in ponds, and displayed in aquariums in homes, offices, or public settings. Recreational
          fishing
          is
          fishing primarily for pleasure or competition; it can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is
          fishing
          for
          profit, or artisanal fishing, which is fishing primarily for food. The most common form of recreational
          fishing
          employs
          a rod, reel, line, hooks, and a wide range of baits. Recreational fishing is particularly popular in North
          America
          and
          Europe; government agencies often actively manage target fish species.
